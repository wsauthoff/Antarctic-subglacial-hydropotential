# Subglacial hydropotential

## About the dataset

This repository contains code and metadata related to the generation of a 500-m gridded Antarctic subglacial hydropotential dataset, derived from variables in the on BedMachine Antarctica dataset (Morlighem et al., 2020; Morlighem, 2022). The generated hydropotential dataset is distributed via Zenodo in NetCDF4 and Zarr formats.

## Subglacial hydropotential (θₕ)
Subglacial hydropotential (hydraulic potential) represents the total force per unit area exerted on subglacial water by gravitational potential energy and ice overburden pressure. Hydropotential is a key control on basal water flow direction and magnitude beneath ice sheets.

This dataset provides a stationary field of hydropotential computed as (following Shreve, 1972):

**θg** = ρ<sub>water</sub> ⋅ g ⋅ z<sub>bed</sub>  
*(gravitational potential)*

**θₕ** = ρ<sub>water</sub> ⋅ g ⋅ z<sub>bed</sub> + (ρ<sub>ice</sub> ⋅ g ⋅ h<sub>ice</sub>)  
*(combine terms; add ice overburden)*

**θₕ** = g ⋅ [ρ<sub>water</sub> ⋅ z<sub>bed</sub> + ρ<sub>ice</sub> ⋅ (z<sub>surface</sub> − z<sub>bed</sub>)] − N  
*(add effective pressure)*

> Effective pressure is the ice overburden pressure minus the basal water pressure; this variable often poorly assumed to be zero because of lack of observations

**θₕ** = g ⋅ [ρ<sub>water</sub> ⋅ z<sub>bed</sub> + (ρ<sub>ice</sub> ⋅ z<sub>surface</sub>) − (ρ<sub>ice</sub> ⋅ z<sub>bed</sub>)]  
*(ignore effective pressure; distribute ρ<sub>ice</sub>)*

**θₕ** = g ⋅ [ρ<sub>water</sub> ⋅ z<sub>bed</sub> − (ρ<sub>ice</sub> ⋅ z<sub>bed</sub>) + (ρ<sub>ice</sub> ⋅ z<sub>surface</sub>)]  
*(reorder terms)*

**θₕ** = g ⋅ [(ρ<sub>water</sub> − ρ<sub>ice</sub>) ⋅ z<sub>bed</sub> + (ρ<sub>ice</sub> ⋅ z<sub>surface</sub>)]  
*(combine z<sub>bed</sub> terms)*

**θₕ** = g ⋅ [(997 − 917 kg/m³) ⋅ z<sub>bed</sub> + (917 kg/m³ ⋅ z<sub>surface</sub>)]  
*(input values of assumed ρ<sub>water</sub> and ρ<sub>ice</sub>)*

**θₕ** = g ⋅ [(80 kg/m³ ⋅ z<sub>bed</sub>) + (917 kg/m³ ⋅ z<sub>surface</sub>)]  
*(simplify)*

**θₕ** = g ⋅ [(80 kg/m³ ⋅ z<sub>bed</sub>) + (917 kg/m³ ⋅ (z<sub>surface</sub> - FAC))]  
*(subtract firn air content (FAC) from ice surface elevation to accurately quantify the mass of overlying ice)*

where:
- θg, θₕ = potential, graviational and hydro-
- ρ_water, ρ_ice = densities of freshwater and ice
- g = 9.8 m/s² (acceleration due to gravity)
- z<sub>bed</sub> = bed elevation (from BedMachine Antarctica)
- z<sub>surface</sub> = ice surface elevation (ice surface model used by BedMachine Antarctica)
- FAC = firn air content (FAC model used by BedMachine Antarctica)

### Unit Analysis

Using kg/m³ for density:

m/s² * (kg/m³ * m + kg/m³ * m)

→ m/s² * (kg/m² + kg/m²)

→ m/s² * kg/m²

→ kg / (m·s²) = Pa

Pa = N/m² = force / area (pressure)

Calculated hydropotential values are expressed in kilopascals (kPa) for human readable.

## Usage example (Python)

```python
import xarray as xr

# For NetCDF
ds_nc = xr.open_dataset("subglacial_hydropotential_Antarctica.nc")
hp = ds_nc["hydropotential"]
hp.plot()

# For Zarr
ds_zarr = xr.open_zarr("subglacial_hydropotential_Antarctica.zarr", consolidated=True)
hp = ds_zarr["hydropotential"]
hp.plot()
```
